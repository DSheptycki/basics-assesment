                <p>If you have ever seen the film <b>Ratatouille</b> which is loosely based on my life as a rat going from rags to riches,
                you are probably curious with some of the delicous meals that have been demonstrated in that film, and how to make them. I wish
                to demonstrate my expert techniques in a way that you humans will be able to comprehend, i hope it translates properly. So that
                the people that would like to master the meals that they have been craving, can.
                So thats why this website was created, to answer the questions of those hungry people out there curious of how to make some
                of my delicous recipes

                    My name is Remy and im a rat. I live in Paris, France and have always had a deep sense for the nutritinal arts,
                    compared to the rest of my family, who are pretty much ants when it came to food. I started off with no kitchen,
                    only the food i could find scattered across the garbage cans and open houses of the world and a cook book by my
                    personal hero <i>Auguste Gusteau</i>. I progressed my life from in a sewer to being head chef of a restaurant with some help
                    from a good friend who helped me along my journey.
